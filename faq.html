          <h3 id="ifa-business-acc">What is an IFA Business Account and how does it benefit me?</h3>

          <p class="alignText">The IFA network marketing program has been changing the lives of ordinary South Africans for the last 16 years. It was created by Clientele Life in 1998 and since then has paid out R1.6 Billion rand in earnings to all those involved. It is made by South Africans for South Africans and that is why it has been so successful. This account allows you to create a monthly income through refering others. This is called network marketing. Network marketing is used all over the world and has produced thousands of millionaires. It will work for you too.</p>

          <p class="alignText">The IFA program is low risk to get involved, it is provided by a Blue-chip company, Clientele Life, who are registered on the JSE. You receive an affordable and quality product, but more importantly, it provides an opportunity for all South Africans to take financial control over their lives and this is an opportunity that we need in these unknown times in the country. We need to build a self sustaining income. The Business League is here to help you. Let's create change together.</p>
